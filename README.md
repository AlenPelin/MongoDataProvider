Mongo DB Data Provider
======================

MongoDB DataProvider is a DataProvider for Sitecore that allows you to run a Sitecore database on MongoDB (?http://www.mongodb.org/) instead of SQL Server or Oracle. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers document-oriented storage. This is a good fit with CMS data.
